## Used Tools

This project uses the following tools:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/) for backend development
- [Go-Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for route management
- [GoORM](https://gorm.io/) for database communication
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database storage
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation and testing
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization
